# 🚀 Pet Projects from roadmap.sh (Laravel + React)

This repository contains a collection of backend-focused pet projects inspired by the project ideas listed on [roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas).

Each project is built using:

- ⚙️ **Laravel** — as the backend framework (API, database, business logic)
- ⚛️ **React** — as the frontend framework (UI, client-side interactions)

---

## 📌 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice real-world backend scenarios with Laravel
- Improve fullstack development skills by integrating React
- Build a solid portfolio of mini-projects based on common backend challenges

---

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains a standalone project with its own:

- Laravel backend (in `/server`)
- React frontend (in `/client`)
- Database schema (if applicable)
- Setup instructions

## 🧪 Running a Project

1. Clone the repo  
2. Navigate to a specific project folder  
3. Follow its `README.md` for setup and run instructions  
4. Enjoy building!
